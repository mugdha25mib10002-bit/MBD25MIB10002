# Smart Alarm Clock System

<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>
The Smart Alarm Clock System is a Python-based desktop application. It lets users set alarms with precise hours, minutes, and seconds. When the system time matches the alarm time set by the user, it plays an alert sound. This project shows how to develop a graphical user interface, monitor time in real-time, use threading, and practice modular programming.
